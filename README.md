## TODO

Fix Nav bar not being consistent height depending on page content

### My experiences

* Add a card for each experience
* Fill out work experiences
* Look into accessible options for displaying content in a more compact way (maybe have a slide transition on click to show content in same place, or to expand the card to show content below)


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ sudo npm install --unsafe-perm --no-optional

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
